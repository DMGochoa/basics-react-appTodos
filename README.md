# Introductory React Project

Welcome to my Introductory React Project! This is a to-do list application crafted to offer a hands-on experience for those starting out with the React framework. The goal of this project is to provide a practical introduction to the core concepts of React, including components, state management, and event handling.

## Why a To-Do List?

A to-do list is a universal tool that everyone can relate to. Building one with React allows for understanding the dynamic nature of user interfaces and the React way of making them reactive and efficient.

## Project Features

- Add new to-do items with a click of a button.
- Mark items as done or delete them.
- Filter through all, active, or completed tasks.
- Sleek, user-friendly design with a responsive layout.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **Create React App**: To set up the development environment without hassle
- **CSS**: For styling components

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/).
- You are familiar with basic JavaScript and modern ES6+ syntax.

## Setting Up for Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DMGochoa/basics-react-appTodos.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd basics-react-appTodos

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
